# quiz-human-rights

##Motivation
* To create a quiz that displays the scores and initials of the users at the end
* It can be used as a template and the questions can be easily replaced 
* The given quiz is about Human Rights issues
* It can be used to practise the knowledge of the different human rights acts and articles


##Techniques used
* Main focus in this mini project is on using javascript
* There are three js files
* There are techniques for :
* - dynamically creating HTML elements 
* - saving data in localStorage of the browser
* - using JASON for holding the data in localStorage and parsing it to the String to be displayed and used or parsing it back to JASON object to save it in browser
* - using eventListeners
* - setting timeout for certain time length

##Further improvements
* There can be an implementation on automating loading mechanism for different questions into the template of the quiz to make it reusable. E.g. using a export of a questions from spreadsheet, or reading from a file etc.
* Currently, there are template CONSTANT variables that can hold questions as Strings and the strings have to be replaced manually
* - Code can be refactored to follow DRY concept
